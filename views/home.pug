            p Currently, there is a lack of clear and accurate information on the public benefits that immigrants in the U.S. can access and digest. This consequently negatively affects immigrants' healthcare engagement. 
            p Existing digital tools, such as websites and mobile applications, are a promising way to disseminate public benefits information, but there are still barriers and challenges immigrants face when finding and using them.
            //- p But, there are still 4 key challenges immigrants face when finding and using currently available digital tools: (1) information uncertainty, (2) accessibility, (3) emotional barriers, and (4) contextual sensitivity. We aim to address these 4 challenges with RightsforHealth.
