            "question": "Will enrolling in Medicaid while pregnant impact my future opportunities for residency or citizenship?", 
            "answer": "Enroling in federally funded Medicaid, other than support for long term institutional care is not a factor when considering whether a person is likely to become a public charge, and thus will not impact future opportunities for residency or citizenship."

            "question": "If I am undocumented, am I eligible for insurance coverage for prenatal care?", 
            "answer": "Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for health insurance coverage, but prenatal care may be available, depending on state programs. In New York State, undocumented immigrants are eligible for Medicaid coverage for the care and services required for the treatment of medical emergencies. Women with a medically verified pregnancy are eligible for Medicaid coverage throughout the period of their pregnancy regardless of their immigration status and are not required to provide documentation of immigration status through the last day of the month in which the 60-day post-partum period ends. This coverage includes prenatal and limited postpartum care."

            "question": "Can my spouse or civil partner, dependent children under 18, or long-term partner who remained in my home country when I left apply for permission to enter the US under family reunion provisions?",
            "answer": "Depending on the immigration status of the mother, immediate family members of hers can apply for permission to enter the US. However, the child's citizenship status will not enable additional family members to apply for family reunification, since the citizen must be older than 21 to sponsor a family member for a green card."
