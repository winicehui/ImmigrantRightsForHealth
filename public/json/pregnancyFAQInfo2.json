In New York State, undocumented immigrants are eligible for Medicaid coverage for the care and services required for the treatment of medical emergencies. Women with a medically verified pregnancy are eligible for Medicaid coverage throughout the period of their pregnancy regardless of their immigration status and are not required to provide documentation of immigration status through the last day of the month in which the 60-day post-partum period ends. This coverage includes prenatal and limited postpartum care."

A qualified alien may receive benefits if they 1) were receiving SSI and lawfully residing in the US on August 22, 1996, 2) are a lawful permanent resident with 40 qualifying hours of work (including those of a spouse or parent), 3) are an active duty US Armed forces or honorably discharged, 4) were lawfully abiding in the US on August 22, 1996 and are blind or disabled, 5) were granted specific immigration status by DHS within 7 years of filing for SSI (including refugee or asylee).

Under this rule, immigration officials will consider an applicant’s age, health, income, and past receipt of certain cash public benefits, among other things, in determining whether an applicant is likely to become primarily dependent on government benefits in the future. As a practical matter, however, few people are denied green cards because they accepted public benefits."

However, pregnant women with a medically verified pregnancy are not required to produce proof of immigration status, and immigration status will not be considered when applying for emergency medical coverage."

See https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/pc_safe_to_use_list_may_2021.pdf for a list of public benefits programs that are not considered under the public charge rule.

Refugees, asylees, and lawful permanent residents (“green card holders”), however, do not need to wait five years before they can access Medicaid. States have the option of waiving the five-year period for pregnant women (Medicaid) and children (CHIP –Children’s Health Insurance Program). For example, New York has waived the five-year waiting period for pregnant women and children. \n\nAccessing Medicaid is a negative factor in the “public charge” determination.

Some undocumented immigrants may access private health insurance as a spouse or dependent of an employee who receives health insurance through his or her employer. Other undocumented immigrants who are students may receive health insurance through their colleges or universities. Undocumented immigrants can purchase private health insurance on the individual market outside of the ACA marketplaces (i.e. directly from an insurance company), but not all plans on the individual marketplace comply with the ACA.

                "question": "I have legal status, but I don’t have health insurance. How can I get coverage?",
                "answer": "If you previously had health insurance through an employer with at least 20 employees but lost your job due to coronavirus, you have the option of keeping the same health plan through COBRA (The Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act). As your employer will no longer pay part of the monthly premium, however, maintaining the same health plan on your own may be prohibitively expensive. \n\nYou can also compare private insurance plans through ACA marketplaces (Healthcare.gov or your state-run ACA marketplace). Losing your job is considered a “qualifying event” to enroll in a plan on all health insurance exchanges. If you have not lost your job but need health coverage, some states (including New York) have created special enrollment periods in light of the coronavirus pandemic so that uninsured persons can enroll in an ACA insurance plan without a “qualifying event” (the normal enrollment period for Healthcare.gov and state-run ACA marketplaces is in the fall). The federal government has not expanded the enrollment period on Healthcare.gov. \n\nYou should check if you qualify for Medicaid based on the requirements of your state. Individuals can enroll in Medicaid year-round, and as enrollment is based on monthly income, it may be a good option for individuals who have recently lost their job. \n\nIf you cannot find a health insurance plan that works for the adults in your family, your children may be able to get coverage. The rules for children’s and pregnant women’s enrollment in Medicaid are different than for the general public. Go to InsureKidsNow.govto determine if your children are eligible."

As DACA recipients have work authorization, they can access employer-provided private health insurance. \n\nDACA recipients can access emergency Medicaid if they meet the income requirements for Medicaid and arrive to a hospital suffering from an emergency medical condition (meaning that the absence of immediate medical attention could put the patient in serious jeopardy, impair bodily functions, or cause serious disfunction to an organ or body part).

These policy guidelines, however, exist only as internal agency memorandum and not as federal law. While it is possible that ICE will come to a hospital, it is unlikely.

Taxpayers must have a Social Security number to receive the rebate. If an individual filed a tax return in 2018 or 2019 with a valid Social Security number, she will get a rebatein the mail.
