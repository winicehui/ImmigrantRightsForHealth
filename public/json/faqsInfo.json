                    "question": "What does it mean to be a “public charge”?",
                    "answer": "\"Public charge\" is a term used in U.S. immigration law to mean someone who primarily depends on government assistance to survive.If the U.S.immigration agency thinks you are a \"public charge\", you could be refused entry to the United States or deported. \n\n Fortunately, few people are deemed to be a public charge. Only noncitizens who rely on public cash assistance to live or who are institutionalized for long-term care at government expense are considered a public charge. \n\nExamples of disqualifying assistance include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), cash assistance from the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and state or local cash assistance programs (often called \"general assistance\") for income maintenance. Non-cash benefits like Medicaid, food stamps, WIC, unemployment insurance, housing benefits, and child care subsidies are generally fine to receive. \n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n USCIS: \"Public Charge Resources\"\n<a>https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/public-charge/public-charge-resources</a>"

                    "answer": "Yes, but only if your condition is considered an emergency. To access emergency Medicaid, your symptoms must be so severe that, without medical care, you will be at risk of serious health issues. For example, if your symptoms are life-threatening, could affect your bodily functions, or could cause organ failure because of COVID-19, you would qualify for emergency Medicaid.\n\n To qualify for emergency Medicaid in the state of New York, you must meet three requirements: (1) you must have low income; (2) you must be a New York State resident (unless you are a temporary lawful resident); and (3) you must have an emergency medical condition.\n\n Accepting emergency Medicaid will not count against you in a future \"public charge\" decision. \n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n GoodRx Health: \"Healthcare Options for Undocumented Immigrants\"\n<a>https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/patient-advocacy/healthcare-undocumented </a>\n\n NYC.gov: \"Medicaid for the Treatment of an Emergency Medical Condition\"\n<a>https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ochia/downloads/pdf/fly-957-emergency-medicaid-english.pdf </a>"

However, if you are a refugee, asylee, or in certain other immigration statuses, you do not have to wait five years before accessing Medicaid. \n\nAlso, states can decide to waive the five-year period for pregnant women to access Medicaid and for children to access the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). New York, for example, has done this. \n\n Accessing Medicaid is not a negative factor in the \"public charge\" determination, so you can use it freely without being worried about being deemed a \"public charge.\"\n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n Healthcare.gov: \"Coverage for Lawfully Present Immigrants\"\n<a>https://bit.ly/2UTdmBH </a>\n\n Medicaid.gov: \"Medicaid and CHIP Coverage of Lawfully Residing Children & Pregnant Women\"\n<a>https://bit.ly/3e6UAP3 </a>"

                    "answer": "If you are an undocumented immigrant, you cannot buy private health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces. You may be able to get private health insurance if you are a spouse or dependent of someone who receives health insurance through their employer. If you are a student, you may receive health insurance through your college or university. Finally, you can purchase private health insurance directly from an insurance company, but it may be expensive.\n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n The Kaiser Family Foundation: \"Health Coverage and Care of Undocumented Immigrants\"\n<a>https://bit.ly/34lnNBp</a>\n\n Healthinsurance.org: \"Should You Look Outside the ACA's Exchanges?: How your individual health coverage differs – and how it doesn't—when you shop for insurance outside Obamacare''s marketplaces\"\n<a>https://bit.ly/2yELEQz</a>"

                    "answer": "If you had health insurance through a previous employer (and the company had at least 20 employees), but you lost your job because of COVID-19, you can keep that health insurance plan through COBRA (The Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act). Your employer will no longer contribute to paying the monthly premium, though, so it may be expensive to keep that insurance plan. \n\nYou can also compare private insurance plans through ACA Marketplaces (Healthcare.gov or your state-run ACA marketplace). Losing your job qualifies you to enroll in a plan on all health insurance exchanges. If you have not lost your job but need health coverage, some states (including New York) have created special enrollment periods in light of COVID-19 so that uninsured persons can enroll in an ACA insurance plan without a \"qualifying event\" (like losing your job).\n\nYou should check if you qualify for Medicaid based on the requirements of your state. Individuals can enroll in Medicaid year-round, and because enrollment is based on monthly income, it may be a good option if you recently lost your job. \n\nIf you cannot find a health insurance plan that works for the adults in your family, your children may be able to get coverage. The rules for children’s and pregnant women’s enrollment in Medicaid are different than for the general public. Go to <a>InsureKidsNow.gov</a> to determine if your children are eligible.\n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n NPR.org: \"Coronavirus Reset: How to Get Health Insurance Now\"\n<a>https://n.pr/2UVgJrZ</a>"

But, because DACA recipients have work authorization, they can access employer-provided private health insurance. \n\nDACA recipients can access emergency Medicaid if they meet the income requirements for Medicaid and arrive to a hospital suffering from an emergency medical condition (meaning that they would have serious health consequences without immediate medical attention). \n\n <u>Source(s)</u>: \n The Kaiser Family Foundation: \"Key Facts on Individuals Eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program\"\n<a>https://bit.ly/2xfVgkx</a>"

                    "question": "Can applying for public benefits jeopardize a pending green card application?",
                    "answer": "Receipt of public benefits may impact a pending green card application. Green card applicants are subject to the public charge rule. Under this rule, immigration officials will consider an applicant’s age, health, income, and past receipt of certain cash public benefits, among other things, in determining whether an applicant is likely to become primarily dependent on government benefits in the future. As a practical matter, however, few people are denied green cards because they accepted public benefits."
